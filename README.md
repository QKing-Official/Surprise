A fun prank for windows made in java when i was bored

To kill it go to task manager and kill java process.
Harmless, safe to run.
Just wants to say Hello World!
The exe file is more difficult to stop. You need to kill java too. Run in CMD or Powershell. I provide the command here:
```batch
:: Kill Java processes (java.exe, javaw.exe)
taskkill /f /im java.exe
taskkill /f /im javaw.exe
```
